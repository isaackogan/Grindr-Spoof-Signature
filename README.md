# ReVanced Signature Patch Grindr

Fork of [Joar](https://github.com/Slenderman00)'s patch. The general idea is to make it compatible with any version of Grindr,
such that it can be used in https://github.com/isaackogan/Grindr-SSL-Unpinned to automatically unpin new versions of the app on the fly.

# Usage 

To use this project, run `./gradlew build`. The output in the `/build/libs` directory can be used as a multi-platform JAR to patch (ideally) any recent version of the Grindr app.
